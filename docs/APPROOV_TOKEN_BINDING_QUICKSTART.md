# Approov Token Binding Quickstart

This quickstart is for developers familiar with NodeJS who are looking for a quick intro into how they can add [Approov](https://approov.io) into an existing project. Therefore this will guide you through the necessary steps for adding Approov with token binding to an existing NodeJS API server.

## Why?

To lock down your API server to your mobile app. Please read the brief summary in the [Approov Overview](/OVERVIEW.md#why) at the root of this repo or visit our [website](https://approov.io/product/) for more details.

## How it works?

For more background, see the [Approov Overview](/OVERVIEW.md#how-it-works) at the root of this repository.

The main functionality for the Approov token binding check is in the file [src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello-server-protected.js](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello-server-protected.js). Take a look at the `verifyApproovToken()` and `verifyApproovTokenBinding()` functions to see the simple code for the checks.

## Requirements

To complete this quickstart you will need both the NodeJS and the Approov CLI tool installed.

* NodeJS - Follow the official installation instructions from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Approov CLI - Follow our [installation instructions](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) and read more about each command and its options in the [documentation reference](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/)

## Approov Setup

To use Approov with the NodeJS API server we need a small amount of configuration. First, Approov needs to know the API domain that will be protected. Second, the NodeJS API server needs the Approov Base64 encoded secret that will be used to verify the tokens generated by the Approov cloud service.

### Configure API Domain

Approov needs to know the domain name of the API for which it will issue tokens.

Add it with:

```bash
approov api -add your.api.domain.com
```

Adding the API domain also configures the [dynamic certificate pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning) setup, out of the box.

> **NOTE:** By default the pin is extracted from the public key of the leaf certificate served by the domain, as visible to the box issuing the Approov CLI command and the Approov servers.

### Approov Secret

Approov tokens are signed with a symmetric secret. To verify tokens, we need to grab the secret using the [Approov secret command](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#secret-command) and plug it into the NodeJS API server environment to check the signatures of the [Approov Tokens](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) that it processes.

Retrieve the Approov secret with:

```bash
approov secret -get base64
```

> **NOTE:** The `approov secret` command requires an [administration role](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#account-access-roles) to execute successfully.

#### Set the Approov Secret

Open the `.env` file and add the Approov secret to the var:

```bash
APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET=approov_base64_secret_here
```

## Approov Token Check

To check the Approov token we will use the [auth0/node-jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#readme) package, but you are free to use another one of your preference.

Add this functions to your code:

```javascript
const verifyApproovToken = function(req) {

  const appoovToken = req.headers['approov-token']

  if (!appoovToken) {
    // You may want to add some logging here.
    return false
  }

  // decode token, verify secret and check exp
  return jwt.verify(appoovToken, approovSecret, { algorithms: ['HS256'] }, function(err, decoded) {

    if (err) {
      // You may want to add some logging here.
      return false
    }

    // The Approov token was successfully verified. We will add the claims to
    // the request object to allow further use of them during the request
    // processing.
    req.approovTokenClaims = decoded

    return true
  })
}

const verifyApproovTokenBinding = function(req) {

  if (!("pay" in req.approovTokenClaims)) {
    // You may want to add some logging here.
    return false
  }

  // The Approov token claims is added to the request object on a successful
  //  Approov token verification. See `verifyApproovToken()` function.
  token_binding_claim = req.approovTokenClaims.pay

  // We use here the Authorization token, but feel free to use another header,
  // but you need to bind this header to the Approov token in the mobile app.
  token_binding_header = req.headers['authorization']

  if (!token_binding_header) {
    // You may want to add some logging here.
    return false
  }

  // We need to hash and base64 encode the token binding header, because thats
  // how it was included in the Approov token on the mobile app.
  const token_binding_header_encoded = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(token_binding_header, 'utf-8').digest('base64')

  return token_binding_claim === token_binding_header_encoded
}
```

Now you just need to invoke it from the endpoint you want to protected:

```javascript
if (!verifyApproovToken(req)) {
    res.statusCode = 401
    res.end(JSON.stringify({}))
    return
  }

  if (!verifyApproovTokenBinding(req)) {
    res.statusCode = 401
    res.end(JSON.stringify({}))
    return
  }
```

> **NOTE:** When the Approov token validation fails we return a `401` with an empty body, because we don't want to give clues to an attacker about the reason the request failed, and you can go even further by returning a `400`.

A full working example for a simple Hello World server can be found at [src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check).

## Test your Approov Integration

The following examples below use cURL, but you can also use the [Postman Collection](/README.md#testing-with-postman) to make the API requests. Just remember that you need to adjust the urls and tokens defined in the collection to match your deployment. Alternatively, the above README also contains instructions for using the preset _dummy_ secret to test your Approov integration.

#### With Valid Approov Tokens

Generate a valid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```bash
approov token -setDataHashInToken 'Bearer authorizationtoken' -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```bash
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer authorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The request should be accepted. For example:

```text
HTTP/2 200

...

{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

#### With Invalid Approov Tokens

##### No Authorization Token

Let's just remove the Authorization header from the request:

```bash
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/2 401

...

{}
```

##### Same Approov Token with a Different Authorization Token

Make the request with the same generated token, but with another random authorization token:

```bash
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer anotherauthorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should also fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/2 401

...

{}
```
